Kotlin to Java Interpreter

Project Description

The Kotlin to Java Interpreter is a tool designed to seamlessly convert Kotlin code into equivalent Java code. This project aims to bridge the gap between these two popular programming languages, providing developers with an efficient solution for transitioning Kotlin-based projects into Java or vice versa. By automating the conversion process, the interpreter reduces manual work and minimizes the potential for errors, ensuring high code accuracy and readability.
